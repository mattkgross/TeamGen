TeamGen
=======

Allows input of players and then creates teams with evenly distributed skill levels.

The main purpose of this tool is for indoor ultimate team generation. It's been done manually for too long. I'm also wanting to experiement with Local Storage in the browser, so please excuse the rather naive methodology behind team storage. Yes, it's JSON, it's local, and it's ugly. But it should get the job done.
