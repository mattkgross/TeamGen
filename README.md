TeamGen
=======

Allows input of players and then creates teams with evenly distributed skill levels.

The main purpose of this tool is for indoor ultimate team generation. It's been done manually for too long. I'm also wanting to experiment with Local Storage in the browser, so please excuse the rather na√Øve methodology behind team storage. Yes, it's JSON, it's local, and it's ugly. But it should get the job done.

Installation Instructions
================

Installing this tool is a simple 3 step process. You should be up in running in under a minute. :)

1. Select your [desired release](/releases), and click the `Source code (zip)` link below it and save the file to a memorable location (such as your Desktop).
2. Unzip/extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Open "index.html" in your preferred browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended; IE supported but not tested).

It's that easy! You're now ready to start registering players and creating teams!
