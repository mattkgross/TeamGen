        <h2>General Info</h2><br>
        <p>This tool was created in order to provide a simple means to register players and create teams of an evenly distributed skill level. Please <a href="http://www.mattkgross.com" target="_blank">let me know</a> if there's any trouble you run into.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Please Note: This is not a distributed system. Each browser will have its own data. Team data cannot be shared across multiple browsers or computers. One tournament director, one computer, one player list.</p>
        <hr><br>
        <h2>Adding Players</h2><br>
        <p>To add players to the list, simply input their information (first &amp; last names, height, gender, and rating required). The player list is kept even if the browser is closed. So, if you are starting a new tourney, be sure to clear out the previous team. Players can be individually deleted from the list by accessing &quot;View Player List&quot; and clicking the &quot;&times;&quot; by their name.</p>
        <hr><br>
        <h2>Generating Teams</h2><br>
        <p>Once you have input all of the players, simply select the number of teams you would like to create. You also have the option of downloading all of the player information to a CSV file for future reference. Don't like the teams? Simply regenerate. Again, once you're done, remeber to clear the player list for the next use. <strong>The player list will persist until you delete it.</strong></p>
        <hr><br>
        <h2>How Does Sorting Work?</h2><br>
        <p>Sorting is performed in the following hierarchy: division (college, high school, or none), sex, ranking, and, finally, height. Keep in mind that, if you elect the optional sortings of height or division, the overall entropy of the sort will be greatly decreased. The more constraints, the less the variability. I would recommend, unless you have a high amount of participants (80+), that you choose either sort by height or by division, but not both. Do what you will!</p>
